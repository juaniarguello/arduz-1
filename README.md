# Original Idea


Arduz online is a mod of Argentum Online (The first Argentinian MMORPG , developed by Pablo MÃ¡rquez and Fernando Testa). 
Arduz Online was developed by @menduz

## Arduz Online 2008

Arduz is a "click & play" style game given after the modification of the Argentine game Argentum Online. It was developed during 2008 from version 12.1, which underwent severe modifications to give rise to a video game integrated into a web page. Although it is primarily an internet game, there is the possibility of playing it via LAN between 2 or more computers.  

## Game Development

The activity of the game takes place through different maps where players can choose sides (red or blue) and must fulfill the characteristic mission of the map (usually being the destruction of the opposing team). Each player can open their own mini-server and gain administrator powers to organize their game.

## Race-Class Chooses

The possibilities for choosing race-class are quite limited due to balance arrangements. That is to say, the races are prefixed according to the best combinations with each class. This is not entirely an impediment, since players can freely change classes or sides without a fixed decision.
